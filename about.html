        <p>Remember the passion(in essence) and optimism of being a kid. You were brave enough to be yourself and to do things your way. You saw the possibility, the wonders of the world around you. Before you grew up, before the walls went up, before somebody
            told you, the rules or where you fit in. You were brave enough to see the magic in you.</p>

        <p>If such imaginations/ideas are well nurtured/incubated through technological innovations, could bring Africa to an entirely new level. </p>

        <p>Thank you @Stirling University for offering me Unconditional Offer in MSC Financial Technology. I will remain determined, focused and passionate in pursuing my childhood dream of improving the lives and livelihood of People of Africa through Financial
            and Technological innovations by leveraging on my background in Finance and Software development.</p>
